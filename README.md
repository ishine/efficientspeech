# EfficientSpeech: An On-Device Text to Speech Model

**EfficientSpeech**, or **ES** for short, is an efficient neural text to speech (TTS) model. It generates mel spectrogram at a speed of 104 (mRTF) or 104 secs of speech per sec on an RPi4. Its tiny version has a footprint of just 266k parameters. Generating 6 secs of speech consumes 90 MFLOPS only.
